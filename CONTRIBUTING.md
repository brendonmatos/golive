If you have a question or problem with Golive and you believe that found a defect in or its documentation, feel free to use the GitHub issue tracker to report 

## Code Contribution
**Bug fixes are, of course, always welcome.**
It's really easy to contribute to GoLive. GoLive provides the client and server parts. So if your change doesn't break the API that is used to write the component, it's totally ok to submit. Open up a PR and I will review and hopefully merge
